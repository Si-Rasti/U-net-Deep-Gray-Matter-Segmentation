# Deep Gray Matter Segmentation by U-net Model
An automated U-net for segmenting deep gray matter structures (right and left thalamus in the accompanied code) from the whole brain T1MPRAGE MRI images (NIFTI format) is shared. I used the the referenced(1) dataset for training the model and tested the results on our instituitional data. The skeleton for this code is adopted from keras.io website(2).
